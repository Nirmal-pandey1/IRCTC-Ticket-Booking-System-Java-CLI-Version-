# IRCTC Ticket Booking 
This is a command-line-based IRCTC Ticket Booking System implemented in Java. The project simulates a basic railway ticket reservation system where users can sign up, log in, search trains, book tickets, and view booking history. The application uses file-based JSON storage to manage users, trains, and bookings without the need for an external database.
